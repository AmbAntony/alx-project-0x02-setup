Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
Implement the Header component for navigation
Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
Test each component and page as you build them

## Expected Outcomes
A fully functional Next.js application
Reusable components that follow TypeScript best practices
Proper routing between different pages
API integration to fetch and display data
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Clean, well-organized codebase
